# Divergence

## Introduction

Divergence is a way of managing and maintaining an Android `RecyclerView.Adapter` that contains many sub-adapters. It lets you concentrate on writing individualized business logic in small, understandable adapters, and removes the complexity of dealing with the global adapter state.
